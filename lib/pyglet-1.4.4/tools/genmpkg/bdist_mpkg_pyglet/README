Description: 
        bdist_mpkg is a distutils plugin that implements the bdist_mpkg
        command, which builds a Mac OS X metapackage for use by Installer.app
        for easy GUI installation of Python modules, much like bdist_wininst.
        
        It also comes with a bdist_mpkg script, which is a setup.py front-end
        that will allow you to easy build an installer metapackage from nearly
        any existing package that uses distutils.
