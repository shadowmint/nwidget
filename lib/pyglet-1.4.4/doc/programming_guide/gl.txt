The OpenGL interface
====================

pyglet provides an interface to OpenGL and GLU.  The interface is used by all
of pyglet's higher-level API's, so that all rendering is done efficiently by
the graphics card, rather than the operating system.  You can access this
interface directly; using it is much like using OpenGL from C.

The interface is a "thin-wrapper" around ``libGL.so`` on Linux,
``opengl32.dll`` on Windows and ``OpenGL.framework`` on OS X.  The pyglet
maintainers regenerate the interface from the latest specifications, so it is
always up-to-date with the latest version and almost all extensions.

The interface is provided by the ``pyglet.gl`` package.  To use it you will
need a good knowledge of OpenGL, C and ctypes.  You may prefer to use OpenGL
without using ctypes, in which case you should investigate `PyOpenGL`_.
`PyOpenGL`_ provides similar functionality with a more "Pythonic" interface,
and will work with pyglet without any modification.

Using OpenGL
------------

Documentation of OpenGL and GLU are provided at the `OpenGL website`_ and
(more comprehensively) in the `OpenGL Programming Guide`_.

Importing the package gives access to OpenGL, GLU, and all OpenGL registered
extensions.   This is sufficient for all but the most advanced uses of
OpenGL::

    from pyglet.gl import *

All function names and constants are identical to the C counterparts.  For
example, the following program draws a triangle on the screen::

    from pyglet.gl import *

    # Direct OpenGL commands to this window.
    window = pyglet.window.Window()

    @window.event
    def on_draw():
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
        glLoadIdentity()
        glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES)
        glVertex2f(0, 0)
        glVertex2f(window.width, 0)
        glVertex2f(window.width, window.height)
        glEnd()

    pyglet.app.run()

Some OpenGL functions require an array of data.  These arrays must be
constructed as ``ctypes`` arrays of the correct type.  The following example
draw the same triangle as above, but uses a vertex array instead of the
immediate-mode functions.  Note the construction of the vertex array using a
one-dimensional ``ctypes`` array of ``GLfloat``::

    from pyglet.gl import *

    window = pyglet.window.Window()

    vertices = [
        0, 0,
        window.width, 0,
        window.width, window.height]
    vertices_gl = (GLfloat * len(vertices))(*vertices)

    glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY)
    glVertexPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, vertices_gl)

    @window.event
    def on_draw():
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
        glLoadIdentity()
        glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, len(vertices) // 2)

    pyglet.app.run()

Similar array constructions can be used to create data for vertex buffer
objects, texture data, polygon stipple data and the map functions.

Resizing the window
-------------------

pyglet sets up the viewport and an orthographic projection on each window
automatically.  It does this in a default `on_resize` handler defined on
`Window`::

    @window.event
    def on_resize(width, height):
        glViewport(0, 0, width, height)
        glMatrixMode(gl.GL_PROJECTION)
        glLoadIdentity()
        glOrtho(0, width, 0, height, -1, 1)
        glMatrixMode(gl.GL_MODELVIEW)

If you need to define your own projection (for example, to use
a 3-dimensional perspective projection), you should override this
event with your own; for example::

    @window.event
    def on_resize(width, height):
        glViewport(0, 0, width, height)
        glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)
        glLoadIdentity()
        gluPerspective(65, width / float(height), .1, 1000)
        glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)
        return pyglet.event.EVENT_HANDLED

Note that the `on_resize` handler is called for a window the first time
it is displayed, as well as any time it is later resized.

Error checking
--------------

By default, pyglet calls ``glGetError`` after every GL function call (except
where such a check would be invalid).  If an error is reported, pyglet raises
``GLException`` with the result of ``gluErrorString`` as the message.

This is very handy during development, as it catches common coding errors
early on.  However, it has a significant impact on performance, and is
disabled when python is run with the ``-O`` option.

You can also disable this error check by setting the following option `before`
importing ``pyglet.gl`` or ``pyglet.window``::

    # Disable error checking for increased performance
    pyglet.options['debug_gl'] = False

    from pyglet.gl import *

Setting the option after importing ``pyglet.gl`` will have no effect.  Once
disabled, there is no error-checking overhead in each GL call.

Using extension functions
-------------------------

Before using an extension function, you should check that the extension is
implemented by the current driver.  Typically this is done using
``glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)``, but pyglet has a convenience module,
`pyglet.gl.gl_info` that does this for you::

    if pyglet.gl.gl_info.have_extension('GL_ARB_shadow'):
        # ... do shadow-related code.
    else:
        # ... raise an exception, or use a fallback method

You can also easily check the version of OpenGL::

    if pyglet.gl.gl_info.have_version(1,5):
        # We can assume all OpenGL 1.5 functions are implemented.

Remember to only call the ``gl_info`` functions after creating a window.

There is a corresponding ``glu_info`` module for checking the version and
extensions of GLU.

nVidia often release hardware with extensions before having them registered
officially.  When you ``import * from pyglet.gl`` you import only the
registered extensions.  You can import the latest nVidia extensions
with::

    from pyglet.gl.glext_nv import *

Using multiple windows
----------------------

pyglet allows you to create and display any number of windows simultaneously.
Each will be created with its own OpenGL context, however all contexts will
share the same texture objects, display lists, shader programs, and so on,
by default [#objects]_.  Each context has its own state and framebuffers.

There is always an active context (unless there are no windows).  When using
`pyglet.app.run` for the application event loop, pyglet ensures that
the correct window is the active context before dispatching the `on_draw`
or `on_resize` events.  

In other cases, you can explicitly set the active context with
`Window.switch_to`.

.. [#objects] Sometimes objects and lists cannot be shared between contexts; for
              example, when the contexts are provided by different video
              devices.  This will usually only occur if you explicitly select
              different screens driven by different devices.

AGL, GLX and WGL
----------------

The OpenGL context itself is managed by an operating-system specific library:
AGL on OS X, GLX under X11 and WGL on Windows.  pyglet handles these details
when a window is created, but you may need to use the functions directly (for
example, to use pbuffers) or an extension function.

The modules are named ``pyglet.gl.agl``, ``pyglet.gl.glx`` and
``pyglet.gl.wgl``.  You must only import the correct module for the running
operating system::

    if sys.platform == 'linux2':
        from pyglet.gl.glx import *
        glxCreatePbuffer(...)
    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':
        from pyglet.gl.agl import *
        aglCreatePbuffer(...)

There are convenience modules for querying the version and extensions of WGL
and GLX named ``pyglet.gl.wgl_info`` and ``pyglet.gl.glx_info``, respectively.
AGL does not have such a module, just query the version of OS X instead.

If using GLX extensions, you can import ``pyglet.gl.glxext_arb`` for the
registered extensions or ``pyglet.gl.glxext_nv`` for the latest nVidia
extensions.

Similarly, if using WGL extensions, import ``pyglet.gl.wglext_arb`` or
``pyglet.gl.wglext_nv``.
