The application event loop
==========================

In order to let pyglet process operating system events such as mouse and
keyboard events, applications need to enter an application event loop.  The
event loop continuously checks for new events, dispatches those events, and
updates the contents of all open windows.

pyglet provides an application event loop that is tuned for performance and
low power usage on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.  Most applications need only
call::

    pyglet.app.run()

to enter the event loop after creating their initial set of windows and
attaching event handlers.  The `run` function does not return until all open
windows have been closed, or until ``pyglet.app.exit()`` is called.

The pyglet application event loop dispatches window events (such as for mouse
and keyboard input) as they occur and dispatches the `on_draw` event to 
each window after every iteration through the loop.

To have additional code run periodically or every iteration through the loop,
schedule functions on the clock (see `Scheduling functions for future
execution`).  pyglet ensures that the loop iterates only as often as necessary
to fulfil all scheduled functions and user input.

Customising the event loop
--------------------------

The pyglet event loop is encapsulated in the `EventLoop` class, which provides
several hooks that can be overridden for customising its behaviour.  This is
recommended only for advanced users -- typical applications and games are
unlikely to require this functionality.

To use the `EventLoop` class directly, instantiate it and call `run`::

    pyglet.app.EventLoop().run()

Only one `EventLoop` can be running at a time; when the `run` method is called
the module variable `pyglet.app.event_loop` is set to the running instance.
Other pyglet modules such as `pyglet.window` depend on this.

Event loop events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can listen for several events on the event loop instance.  The most useful
of these is `on_window_close`, which is dispatched whenever a window is
closed.  The default handler for this event exits the event loop if there are
no more windows.  The following example overrides this behaviour to exit the
application whenever any window is closed::

    event_loop = pyglet.app.EventLoop()

    @event_loop.event
    def on_window_close(window):
        event_loop.exit()
        return pyglet.event.EVENT_HANDLED

    event_loop.run()

Overriding the default idle policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `EventLoop.idle` method is called every iteration of the event loop.  It
is responsible for calling scheduled clock functions, redrawing windows, and
deciding how idle the application is.  You can override this method if you
have specific requirements for tuning the performance of your application;
especially if it uses many windows.

The default implementation has the following algorithm:

1. Call `clock.tick` with ``poll=True`` to call any scheduled functions.
2. Dispatch the `on_draw` event and call `flip` on every open window.
3. Return the value of `clock.get_sleep_time`.

The return value of the method is the number of seconds until the event loop
needs to iterate again (unless there is an earlier user-input event); or
``None`` if the loop can wait for input indefinitely.

Note that this default policy causes every window to be redrawn during every
user event -- if you have more knowledge about which events have an effect on
which windows you can improve on the performance of this method.

Dispatching events manually
---------------------------

Earlier versions of pyglet and certain other windowing toolkits such as PyGame
and SDL require the application developer to write their own event loop.
This "manual" event loop is usually just an inconvenience compared to
`pyglet.app.run`, but can be necessary in some situations when combining
pyglet with other toolkits.

A simple event loop usually has the following form::

    while True:
        pyglet.clock.tick()

        for window in pyglet.app.windows:
            window.switch_to()
            window.dispatch_events()
            window.dispatch_event('on_draw')
            window.flip()

The `dispatch_events` method checks the window's operating system event queue
for user input and dispatches any events found.  The method does not wait for
input -- if ther are no events pending, control is returned to the program
immediately.

The call to `pyglet.clock.tick()` is required for ensuring scheduled functions
are called, including the internal data pump functions for playing sounds and
video.

Developers are strongly discouraged from writing pyglet applications with
event loops like this:

* The `EventLoop` class provides plenty of hooks for most toolkits to be
  integrated without needing to resort to a manual event loop.
* Because `EventLoop` is tuned for specific operating systems, it is more
  responsive to user events, and continues calling clock functions while
  windows are being resized, and (on Mac OS X) the menu bar is being tracked.
* It is difficult to write a manual event loop that does not consume
  100% CPU while still remaining responsive to user input.

The capability for writing manual event loops remains for legacy support and
extreme circumstances.
