  <h2>about pyglet</h2>
  <p>
    pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing
    games and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and
    Linux.  Some of the features of pyglet are:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No external dependencies or installation
      requirements.</strong>  For most application and game requirements,
      pyglet needs nothing else besides Python, simplifying distribution
      and installation.</li>

      <li><strong>Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor
      desktops.</strong>  pyglet allows you to use as many windows as you
      need, and is fully aware of multi-monitor setups for use with
      fullscreen games.</li>

      <li><strong>Load images, sound, music and video in almost any
      format.</strong>  pyglet can optionally use 
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avbin">AVbin</a> to play back audio
      formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and WMA, and video formats such as DivX,
      MPEG-2, H.264, WMV and Xvid.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license, allowing you to
  use it for both commerical and other open-source projects with very
  little restriction.</p>
