pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games
and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Requirements
------------

pyglet runs with Python 2.5+ and also with Python 3 through 2to3 tool (which
is executed automatically when installing). pyglet works on the following
operating systems:

* Windows XP or later
* Mac OS X 10.3 or later
* Linux, with the following libraries (most recent distributions will have
  these in a default installation):
    * OpenGL and GLX
    * GDK 2.0 or later (required for loading images)
    * OpenAL or ALSA (required for playing audio)
    
Installation
------------

If you're reading this README from a source distribution, install pyglet
with::

    python setup.py install

There are no compilation steps during the installation; if you prefer, you can
simply add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and use pyglet without
installing it.
