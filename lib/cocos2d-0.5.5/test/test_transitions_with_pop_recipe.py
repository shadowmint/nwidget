TransitionWithPop recipe

While you can apply any cocos transition scene to the scene changes
director.run
director.replace
director.push

they are not builtin scene transitions to apply when doing director.pop

But is easy to implement in your app with the following recipe:

    1. select one of the stock scene transitions, to be found in
       cocos/scenes/transitions.py, say ZzzTransition

    2. define a subclass
        class ZzzTransitionWithPop(ZzzTransition):
            def finish():
                director.pop()

    3. instead of director.pop(), use
            director.replace( ZzzTransitionWithPop(
                              director.scene_stack[0], <other params>))
       where <other params> are the ones needed in the original transition,
       excluding the 'dst' argument

"""

description = """
    A demo for the recipe TransitionWithPop, which shows how to replace a dry
    director.pop() with a more appealing transition to the same scene.
    There is a short multiline string in the code telling the recipe.

    Along the time you will see :

    around t=0.000 : scene1 shows (screen full green)
    around t=2.000 : begins normal transition to scene2 (director.push(...))
    around t=2.500 : transitions ends, scene2 in full view (screen full violet)
    around t=5.000 : starts transition with pop
    around t=5.500 : transition ends, scene1 in full view (screen full green)

    In the console a report about current scene and director.scene_stack changes
    The final scene should be scene1 and len(director.scene_stack) should be the
    same as before the first transition initiated; that's 0 for cocos rev>1066
