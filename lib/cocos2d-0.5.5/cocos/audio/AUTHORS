by Daniel F. Moisset

All other source code (everything outside SDL/ and pygame/) was written by the cocos2d team

Based on the pygame-ctypes port made by Alex Holner: http://pygame.org/ctypes/
    which in turn is based on pygame: http://pygame.org
    made for the Google Summer of Code 2006: http://code.google.com/soc
