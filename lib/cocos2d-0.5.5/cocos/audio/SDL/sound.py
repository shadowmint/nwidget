'''An abstract sound format decoding API.

The latest version of SDL_sound can be found at: http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

The basic gist of SDL_sound is that you use an SDL_RWops to get sound data
into this library, and SDL_sound will take that data, in one of several
popular formats, and decode it into raw waveform data in the format of
your choice. This gives you a nice abstraction for getting sound into your
game or application; just feed it to SDL_sound, and it will handle
decoding and converting, so you can just pass it to your SDL audio
callback (or whatever). Since it gets data from an SDL_RWops, you can get
the initial sound data from any number of sources: file, memory buffer,
network connection, etc.

As the name implies, this library depends on SDL: Simple Directmedia Layer,
which is a powerful, free, and cross-platform multimedia library. It can
be found at http://www.libsdl.org/

Support is in place or planned for the following sound formats:
- .WAV  (Microsoft WAVfile RIFF data, internal.)
- .VOC  (Creative Labs' Voice format, internal.)
- .MP3  (MPEG-1 Layer 3 support, via the SMPEG and mpglib libraries.)
- .MID  (MIDI music converted to Waveform data, internal.)
- .MOD  (MOD files, via MikMod and ModPlug.)
- .OGG  (Ogg files, via Ogg Vorbis libraries.)
- .SPX  (Speex files, via libspeex.)
- .SHN  (Shorten files, internal.)
- .RAW  (Raw sound data in any format, internal.)
- .AU   (Sun's Audio format, internal.)
- .AIFF (Audio Interchange format, internal.)
- .FLAC (Lossless audio compression, via libFLAC.)

    The data is read via an SDL_RWops structure, so it may be coming from
    memory, disk, network stream, etc. The `ext` parameter is merely a hint
    to determining the correct decoder; if you specify, for example, "mp3"
    for an extension, and one of the decoders lists that as a handled
    extension, then that decoder is given first shot at trying to claim the
    data for decoding. If none of the extensions match (or the extension is
    None), then every decoder examines the data to determine if it can
    handle it, until one accepts it. In such a case your SDL_RWops will
    need to be capable of rewinding to the start of the stream.

    If no decoders can handle the data, an exception is raised.

    Optionally, a desired audio format can be specified. If the incoming data
    is in a different format, SDL_sound will convert it to the desired format
    on the fly. Note that this can be an expensive operation, so it may be
    wise to convert data before you need to play it back, if possible, or
    make sure your data is initially in the format that you need it in.
    If you don't want to convert the data, you can specify None for a desired
    format. The incoming format of the data, preconversion, can be found
    in the `Sound_Sample` structure.

    Note that the raw sound data "decoder" needs you to specify both the
    extension "RAW" and a "desired" format, or it will refuse to handle
    the data. This is to prevent it from catching all formats unsupported
    by the other decoders.

    Finally, specify an initial buffer size; this is the number of bytes that
    will be allocated to store each read from the sound buffer. The more you
    can safely allocate, the more decoding can be done in one block, but the
    more resources you have to use up, and the longer each decoding call will
    take. Note that different data formats require more or less space to
    store. This buffer can be resized via `Sound_SetBufferSize`.

    The buffer size specified must be a multiple of the size of a single
    sample point. So, if you want 16-bit, stereo samples, then your sample
    point size is (2 channels   16 bits), or 32 bits per sample, which is four
    bytes. In such a case, you could specify 128 or 132 bytes for a buffer,
    but not 129, 130, or 131 (although in reality, you'll want to specify a
    MUCH larger buffer).

    When you are done with this `Sound_Sample` instance, you can dispose of
    it via `Sound_FreeSample`.

    You do not have to keep a reference to `rw` around. If this function
    suceeds, it stores `rw` internally (and disposes of it during the call
    to `Sound_FreeSample`). If this function fails, it will dispose of the
    SDL_RWops for you.

    Beware that this function can fail for several reasons. If the
    SDL_RWops that feeds the decoder can not seek, this call will almost
    certainly fail, but this can theoretically be avoided by wrapping it
    in some sort of buffering SDL_RWops. Some decoders can never seek,
    others can only seek with certain files. The decoders will set a flag
    in the sample at creation time to help you determine this.

    You should check ``sample.flags & SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_CANSEEK``
    before attempting. `Sound_Seek` reports failure immediately if this
    flag isn't set. This function can still fail for other reasons if the
    flag is set.

    This function can be emulated in the application with `Sound_Rewind`
    and predecoding a specific amount of the sample, but this can be
    extremely inefficient. `Sound_Seek()` accelerates the seek on a
    with decoder-specific code.

    If this function fails, the sample should continue to function as if
    this call was never made. If there was an unrecoverable error,
    ``sample.flags & SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_ERROR`` will be set, which your
    regular decoding loop can pick up.
