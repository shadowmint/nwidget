'''A simple multi-channel audio mixer.

It supports 8 channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single channel
of music, mixed by MidMod MOD, Timidity MIDI or SMPEG MP3 libraries.

The mixer can currently load Microsoft WAVE files and Creative Labs VOC
files as audio samples, and can load MIDI files via Timidity and the
following music formats via MikMod: MOD, S3M, IT, XM.  It can load Ogg
Vorbis streams as music if built with the Ogg Vorbis libraries, and finally
it can load MP3 music using the SMPEG library.

The process of mixing MIDI files to wave output is very CPU intensive, so
if playing regular WAVE files sounds great, but playing MIDI files sounds
choppy, try using 8-bit audio, mono audio, or lower frequencies.

:note: The music stream does not resample to the required audio rate.  You
    must call `Mix_OpenAudio` with the sampling rate of your music track.

def Mix_RegisterEffect(chan, f, d, arg):
    '''Register a special effect function.

    At mixing time, the channel data is copied into a buffer and passed
    through each registered effect function.  After it passes through all
    the functions, it is mixed into the final output stream. The copy to
    buffer is performed once, then each effect function performs on the
    output of the previous effect. Understand that this extra copy to a
    buffer is not performed if there are no effects registered for a given
    chunk, which saves CPU cycles, and any given effect will be extra
    cycles, too, so it is crucial that your code run fast. Also note that
    the data that your function is given is in the format of the sound
    device, and not the format you gave to `Mix_OpenAudio`, although they
    may in reality be the same. This is an unfortunate but necessary speed
    concern. Use `Mix_QuerySpec` to determine if you can handle the data
    before you register your effect, and take appropriate actions.

    You may also specify a callback (`d`) that is called when the channel
    finishes playing. This gives you a more fine-grained control than
    `Mix_ChannelFinished`, in case you need to free effect-specific
    resources, etc. If you don't need this, you can specify None.

    You may set the callbacks before or after calling `Mix_PlayChannel`.

    Things like `Mix_SetPanning` are just internal special effect
    functions, so if you are using that, you've already incurred the
    overhead of a copy to a separate buffer, and that these effects will be
    in the queue with any functions you've registered. The list of
    registered effects for a channel is reset when a chunk finishes
    playing, so you need to explicitly set them with each call to
    ``Mix_PlayChannel*``.

    You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
    final mixing occurs. The rules for these callbacks are identical to
    those in `Mix_RegisterEffect`, but they are run after all the channels
    and the music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas
    channel-specific effects run on a given channel before any other mixing
    occurs. These global effect callbacks are call "posteffects".
    Posteffects only have their `d` function called when they are
    unregistered (since the main output stream is never "done" in the same
    sense as a channel).  You must unregister them manually when you've had
    enough. Your callback will be told that the channel being mixed is
    (`MIX_CHANNEL_POST`) if the processing is considered a posteffect.

    After all these effects have finished processing, the callback
    registered through `Mix_SetPostMix` runs, and then the stream goes to
    the audio device.

    Do not call `SDL_LockAudio` from your callback function.

    :Parameters:
        `chan` : int
            Channel to set effect on, or `MIX_CHANNEL_POST` for postmix.

    `Mix_SetPanning` and others may use this API under the hood. This is
    called internally when a channel completes playback.

    but they may be explicitly unregistered through this function by

    Setting (channel) to `MIX_CHANNEL_POST` registers this as a posteffect, and

    (540 becomes 180 degrees, -100 becomes 260).  Angle 0 is due north, and
    rotates clockwise as the value increases.  For efficiency, the
    precision of this effect may be limited (angles 1 through 7 might all
    produce the same effect, 8 through 15 are equal, etc).  `distance` is
    an integer between 0 and 255 that specifies the space between the sound
    and the listener. The larger the number, the further away the sound is.
    Using 255 does not guarantee that the channel will be culled from the
    mixing process or be completely silent. For efficiency, the precision
    of this effect may be limited (distance 0 through 5 might all produce
    the same effect, 6 through 10 are equal, etc). Setting `angle` and
    `distance` to 0 unregisters this effect, since the data would be
    unchanged.

    If you need more precise positional audio, consider using OpenAL for
    spatialized effects instead of SDL_mixer. This is only meant to be a
    basic effect for simple "3D" games.

    If the audio device is configured for mono output, then you won't get
    any effectiveness from the angle; however, distance attenuation on the
    channel will still occur. While this effect will function with stereo
    voices, it makes more sense to use voices with only one channel of
    sound, so when they are mixed through this effect, the positioning will
    sound correct. You can convert them to mono through SDL before giving
    them to the mixer in the first place if you like.

    Setting `channel` to `MIX_CHANNEL_POST` registers this as a posteffect,
    and the positioning will be done to the final mixed stream before

    If you need more precise positional audio, consider using OpenAL for
    spatialized effects instead of SDL_mixer. This is only meant to be a
    basic effect for simple "3D" games.
    
    Setting `channel` to `MIX_CHANNEL_POST` registers this as a posteffect,
    and the distance attenuation will be done to the final mixed stream
    before passing it on to the audio device.
    
    This uses the `Mix_RegisterEffect` API internally.

    This is handy if the user has his or her speakers hooked up backwards,
    or you would like to have a minor bit of psychedelia in your sound
    code.  Calling this function with `flip` set to non-zero reverses the
    chunks's usual channels. If `flip` is zero, the effect is unregistered.
    
    This uses the `Mix_RegisterEffect` API internally, and thus is probably
    more CPU intensive than having the user just plug in his speakers
    correctly.  `Mix_SetReverseStereo` returns without registering the
    effect function if the audio device is not configured for stereo
    output.
    
    If you specify `MIX_CHANNEL_POST` for `channel`, then this the effect
    is used on the final mixed stream before sending it on to the audio
    device (a posteffect).
