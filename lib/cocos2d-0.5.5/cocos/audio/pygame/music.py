'''Pygame module for controlling streamed audio

The music module is closely tied to pygame.mixer. Use the music module to
control the playback of music in the sound mixer.

The difference between the music playback and regular Sound playback is that
the music is streamed, and never actually loaded all at once. The mixer system
only supports a single music stream at once.
